# voxelworld
### What is voxelworld?
voxelworld is my high school project for my "Basics of game programming" course.

### Why is this prject abandoned?
This project has been abandoned, because i started to rewrite the whole game in C#.
The rewrite also features a few things that i had to drop due to time issues like:
- infinite world
- saving/loading
- better ambient occlusion
- less mushy physics
- better performance
